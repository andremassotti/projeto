<h1>about</h1>

<p>Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, I started my design education in 2010 in PUC-Rio, where I studied Graphic Design. Since then, my areas of professional and creative interest cover editorial, digital, graphic, branding, motion, UI, Design strategy and Design Thinking, etc. My focus is to develop project and strategy that solve design problems.</p>
